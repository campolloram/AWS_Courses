# AWS_Courses
Hey everyone!

This repository contains my personal notes for the AWS certificates I plan to take. These notes are based of the courses made by Adrian Cantrill, full credit for all the media and information.

You can find his courses in his webpage:

Really recommend them :)


**NOTE: If you search for "Exam" in the notes you can find possible exam questions as well as things to keep in mind.**
